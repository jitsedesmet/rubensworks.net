  Ghent University, at which I studied, uses a digital learning platform called 'Minerva'.
  Initially, Minerva was not mobile-friendly. That is why I created an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubensworks.minervaandroid" target="_blank">Android application</a> for it
  which is currently not being maintained anymore.
</p>

<p>
  The application is built on top of a <a href="http://minerva.rubensworks.net/site/documentation" target="_blank">Minerva API</a> which
  <a href="https://github.com/rubensworks/Minerva-API" target="_blank">I created</a> as well.
  The API scrapes the Minerva website and makes it available in XML.
</p>

<p>
  The application is able to consume the API using the <a href="https://github.com/rubensworks/Minerva-Android-Library" target="_blank">Minerva Android Library</a>.
