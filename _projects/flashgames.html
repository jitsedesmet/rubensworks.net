<p>
  I learned a lot about programming by working with Flash's Actionscript.
  Here you can see some of the games I created, which are for some reason still available online.
</p>

<h2><a href="http://flashgamedistribution.com/game/The-Maze-Adventure" target="_blank">The Maze Aventure</a></h2>
<p>
  A simple game in which you had to guide a ball through a maze in a 2D environment.
  It had several obstacles like walls, boosts, mines, locked doors and even flying aliens.
</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/rubensworks/piano-avoider-mobile" target="_blank">Piano Avoider</a></h2>
<p>
  A very simple game I created for a mobile game contest in which you are controlling a person that had to run
  around and avoid falling pianos.
</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/rubensworks/the-maze-adventure-2" target="_blank">The Maze Aventure 2</a></h2>
<p>
  A total remake of The Maze Aventure 1 with more levels, better gameplay and fancier graphics.
  The game was written in such a way that it would be possible for players to create their own levels,
  submit them, and share them with other people to play.
  Unfortunately, I never got around to implementing this.
