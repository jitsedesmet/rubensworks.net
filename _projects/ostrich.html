<p>
  <a href="https://rdfostrich.github.io/article-jws2018-ostrich/">OSTRICH</a> is an <em>RDF triple store</em> that allows <em>multiple versions</em> of a dataset to be stored at the same time.
</p>

<p>
  It uses an efficient datastructure to only store <em>differences</em> with respect to the initial dataset versions,
  which achieves an efficient dataset compression rate.
  Next to that, it provides several built-in algorithms to enable efficient iterator-based queries
  <em>at</em> a certain version, <em>between</em> any two versions, and <em>for</em> versions.
</p>

<p>
	OSTRICH has been implemented in C++, and is <a href="https://github.com/rdfostrich/ostrich">open-source</a>.
	Next to that, <a href="https://github.com/rdfostrich/ostrich-node">JavaScript bindings for Node.js</a> have also been implemented.
	Finally, we also provide a <a href="https://github.com/rdfostrich/comunica-actor-init-sparql-ostrich">Comunica query engine</a> that allows versioned SPARQL querying over OSTRICH stores.
