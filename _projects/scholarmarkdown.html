  <a href="https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown">ScholarMarkdown</a> is an open-source framework (written in Ruby) for writing articles in the lightweight Markdown syntax,
  with automatic translation into HTML+RDFa, and the option to output <a href="https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown/wiki/PDF-Compilation">PDF</a>.
  It provides syntactic sugar to easily perform common tasks such as
  <a href="https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown/wiki/Snippets#citations">citing articles</a>,
  writing <a href="https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown/wiki/Snippets#math-equations">math equations</a>,
  and <a href="https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown/wiki/Snippets">more</a>.

  The Markdown-based source files enables straightforward versioning and collaborative editing with version-control systems such as git,
  and integrates nicely with automated <a href="https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown/wiki/Self-publishing">self-publishing via solutions such as GitHub pages</a>,
