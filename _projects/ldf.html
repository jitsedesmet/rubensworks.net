  <a href="http://linkeddatafragments.org/">Linked Data Fragments</a> is a research area where different kinds of Linked Data interfaces are investigated.
  <a href="http://linkeddatafragments.org/concept/">As multiple Linked Data interfaces exist</a>, different techniques are needed to achieve Web-scale querying over one or more of these interfaces.
  Good Linked Data interfaces for data publishers depend on a range of factors, and the right choice is a matter of trade-offs.
