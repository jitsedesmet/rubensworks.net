  TGC Games (The Game Collection) was a Flash gaming website.
  On average, it had 1000 to 1500 daily visitors that could play thousands of Flash games.

  The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120112020840/http://www.tgcgames.com/" target="_blank">website</a> had a
  PHP back-end that was built with the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/" target="_blank">Yii framework</a>.
  New games were automatically fed into the website from distribution sources like
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mochi_Media" target="_blank">Mochi Media</a> and <a href="http://flashgamedistribution.com/" target="_blank">FlashGameDistribution</a>.
