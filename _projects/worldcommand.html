  When I was 16 years old, I really enjoyed playing <a href="http://www.travian.com/" target="_blank">Travian</a>,
  which is a browser-based MMO game that allowed you to build and conquer empires.
  There were some things that I did not like about that game.
  Since I was learning to program at that time using PHP, I realized that I could just make my
  own variant of the game.

  World Command was a game in which you could create cities.
  You could add building and upgrade them.
  Each building had a specific goal.
  For example, some allowed you to collect resources.
  Upgrading those buildings allowed you to collect resources faster.
  Other building allowed to you to upgrades.
  There even was a combat system in which you could train and upgrade armies
  that could be used to plunder or conquer cities from other players.
