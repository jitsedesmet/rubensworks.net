<p>
  I spend some of my spare time to the modding of this little game called <em>Minecraft</em>.
  Here's a list of the most important mods I currently maintain or have been <a href="#commision">commissioned</a>.
  These mods have been downloaded by millions of people, and are actively used by thousands of players each day.

  If you enjoy any of these mods, consider supporting me on the development of these mods via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/kroeser">Patreon</a>.
