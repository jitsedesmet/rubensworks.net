<p>
During my spare time, I like to make stuff.
This page contains a list of the most notable things I am currently working on, and have worked on in the past.

<ul class="projects">
{% for project in site.projects %}
  {% unless project.end %}
    <li>
		<a href="{{ project.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ project.title }}</a>
		<p class="indent"><em>{{ project.description }}</em></p>
	</li>
  {% endunless %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>
