<p itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">
  My name is <span itemprop="name">Ruben Taelman</span>.
  I am a <strong>Web</strong> <a href="/publications/">researcher</a> at <span itemprop="affiliation"><a href="http://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en" target="_blank">IDLab</a>, imec, Ghent University</span>
  with a focus on investigating <strong>decentralized</strong> <strong>publication</strong> and <strong>querying</strong> techniques for <strong>Linked Data</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  The Web and programming in general have always been a great fascination for me,
  as can be seen from the <a href="/projects">different projects</a> I am working on.
  I am a proponent of openness, which is why I aim to <a href="https://github.com/rubensworks?tab=repositories" target="_blank">open-source</a> all my projects whenever possible.
