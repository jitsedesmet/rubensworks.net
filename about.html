<p itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">
  My name is <span itemprop="name">Ruben Taelman</span>.
  I was born on <span itemprop="birthDate">May 12 1992</span> in <span itemprop="birthPlace">Ostend, Belgium</span>.
  I graduated as a Software Engineer from <span itemprop="alumniOf">Ghent University</span> in the summer of 2015.
  After that, I immediately started working as a Semantic Web researcher at <span itemprop="affiliation">Data Science Lab, iMinds, Ghent University</span>.
</p>

<p>
  I have always been fascinated by the Web and programming in general,
  as can be seen from the <a href="/projects">different projects</a> I worked on in the past.
  I am a proponent of openness, which is why I try to <a href="https://github.com/rubensworks?tab=repositories" target="_blank">open-source</a> all my projects whenever possible.
</p>

<p>
  During my master's thesis, I became fascinated by the Semantic Web and more specifically its promising links with artificial intelligence,
  which is why I became a researcher in that domain.
  I am currently doing <a href="/publications/">research</a> in the domain of scalable publication and consumption of dynamic Linked Data.
