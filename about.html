<div class="about-right">
<p itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">
  My name is <span itemprop="name">Ruben Taelman</span>.
  I am a <a href="/publications/">postdoctoral researcher</a> at <span itemprop="affiliation"><a href="http://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en" target="_blank">IDLab</a>, imec, Ghent University</span>
  with a focus on investigating <strong>decentralized</strong> <strong>Web</strong> <strong>querying</strong> and <strong>publication</strong> techniques for <strong>Linked Data</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    My goal is to bring query execution over the Web closer to the end-user,
    so that people become more <em>empowered</em> in how they can find and use data.
    To enable this, I focus on the research area of query execution over decentralized environments.
</p>

<p>
  The Web and programming in general have always been a great fascination for me,
  as can be seen from the <a href="/projects">different projects</a> I am working on.
  I am a proponent of openness, which is why I aim to <a href="https://github.com/rubensworks?tab=repositories" target="_blank">open-source</a> all my projects whenever possible.
</p>

<p>
  Next to my main job as a researcher, I also take up small <strong>freelancing</strong> tasks during my free time.
  If you're interested in hiring me for something, feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>.
