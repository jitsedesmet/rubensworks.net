## Towards Decentralized Knowledge Graphs

TODO: needs for decentralization, Solid

## Queries abstract data access

TODO: hardcoded access is not the way to go

## Opportunistic query execution

TODO:
- different ifaces available with different expressivity
- try to pick most effective during query planning
- LDF axis?
- link traversal is basis, optimizations on top of that

## Link Traversal as a foundation

TODO:
- what it is
- how to optimize it
- how to cope with slowness (because optimizations will only go so far)

## Beyond Link Traversal

TODO:
- Auxiliary indexes: summaries and aggregators
- TREE, ShapeTrees
- SPARQL endpoints, TPF, ...

## Conclusions

TODO:
- Comunica
- Open research questions
- Join us: SolidLab
