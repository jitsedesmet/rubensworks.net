<p class="post-abstract" markdown="1">
The [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) ecosystem
and [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) as its graph data model have been around for many years already.
Even though there is an increasing interest in knowledge graphs,
many developers are scared off by RDF due to its reputation of being *complicated*.
In this post, I will show some concrete examples on how RDF can be used in JavaScript applications,
to illustrate that RDF is actually pretty easy to work with if you use the right tools.
