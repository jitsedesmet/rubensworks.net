The world contains a large amount of sensors that produce new data at
a high frequency. It is currently very hard to find public services that expose these
measurements as dynamic Linked Data. We investigate how sensor data can be
published continuously on the Web at a low cost. This paper describes how the
publication of various sensor data sources can be done by continuously mapping
raw sensor data to RDF and inserting it into a live, low-cost server. This makes it
possible for clients to continuously evaluate dynamic queries using public sensor
data. For our demonstration, we will illustrate how this pipeline works for the
publication of temperature and humidity data originating from a microcontroller,
and how it can be queried.

Linked Data interfaces exist in many flavours, as evidenced by subject
pages, sparql endpoints, triple pattern interfaces, and data dumps. These interfaces
are mostly used to retrieve parts of a complete dataset, such parts can for example be
defined by ranges in one or more dimensions. Filtering Linked Data by dimensions
such as time range, geospatial area, or genomic location, requires the lookup of data
within ordinal ranges. To make retrieval by such ranges generic and cost-efficient,
we propose a REST solution in-between looking up data within ordinal ranges
entirely on the server, or entirely on the client. To this end, we introduce a method
for extending any Linked Data interface with an n-dimensional interface-level index
such that n-dimensional ordinal data can be selected using n-dimensional ranges.
We formally define Range Gates and Range Fragments and theoretically evaluate
the cost-efficiency of hosting such an interface. By adding a multidimensional
index to a Linked Data interface for multidimensional ordinal data, we found that
we can get benefits from both worlds: the expressivity of the server raises, yet
remains more cost-efficient than an interface providing the full functionality on
the server-side. Furthermore, the client now shares in the effort to filter the data.
This makes query processing becomes more flexible to the end-user, because the
query plan can be altered by the engine. In future work we hope to apply Range
Gates and Range Fragments to real-world interfaces to give quicker access to data
within ordinal ranges

Traditional RDF stream processing engines work completely server-side, which contributes to a high server cost.
For allowing a large number of concurrent clients to do continuous querying,
we extend the low-cost Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF) interface with support for time-sensitive queries.
In this poster, we give the overview of a client-side RDF stream processing engine on top of TPF.
Our experiments show that our solution significantly lowers the server load while increasing the load on the clients.
Preliminary results indicate that our solution moves the complexity of continuously evaluating real-time queries
from the server to the client, which makes real-time querying much more scalable for a large amount of concurrent
clients when compared to the alternatives.

Our society is evolving towards massive data consumption from heterogeneous sources, which includes rapidly changing data
like public transit delay information.
Many applications that depend on dynamic data consumption require highly available server interfaces.
Existing interfaces involve substantial costs to publish rapidly changing data with high availability,
and are therefore only possible for
organisations that can afford such an expensive infrastructure.
In my doctoral research, I investigate how to publish and consume real-time and historical Linked Data on a large scale.
To reduce server-side costs for making dynamic data publication affordable,
I will examine different possibilities to divide query evaluation between servers and clients.
This paper discusses the methods I aim to follow together with preliminary results and the steps required to use this solution.
An initial prototype achieves significantly lower server processing cost per query, while maintaining reasonable
query execution times and client costs.
Given these promising results, I feel confident this research direction is a viable solution for offering low-cost
dynamic Linked Data interfaces as opposed to the existing high-cost solutions.

Existing solutions to query dynamic Linked Data sources extend the SPARQL language,
and require continuous server processing for each query.
Traditional SPARQL endpoints accept highly expressive queries, contributing to high server cost.
Extending these endpoints for time-sensitive queries increases the server cost even further.
To make continuous querying over real-time Linked Data more affordable,
we extend the low-cost Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF) interface with support for time-sensitive queries.
In this paper, we discuss a framework on top of TPF that allows clients to execute
SPARQL queries with continuously updating results.
Our experiments indicate that this extension significantly lowers the server complexity.
The trade-off is an increase in the execution time per query.
We prove that by moving the complexity of continuously evaluating real-time queries over Linked Data to the clients
and thus increasing the bandwidth usage, the cost of server-side interfaces is significantly reduced.
Our results show that this solution makes real-time querying more scalable in terms of cpu usage for a large amount
of concurrent clients when compared to the alternatives.

This dissertation investigates the possibilities of having continuously updating
queries over Linked Data with a focus on server availability. This work builds upon the ideas
of Linked Data Fragments to let the clients do most of the work when executing a query. The
server adds metadata to make the clients aware of the data volatility for making sure the
query results are always up-to-date. The implementation of the framework that is proposed,
is eventually tested and compared to other alternative approaches.
