You are more than welcome to contact me for anything <a href="#contact-work">work-related</a> or <a href="#contact-other">other matters</a>.

<h2 id="contact-work">Academic</h2>

Since I am affiliated with Ghent University,
the easiest way to contact me for anything related to my *research* or other *academic matters*,
would be to e-mail me via <a href="mailto:ruben.taelman@ugent.be">ruben.taelman@ugent.be</a>.

If you want to meet me in person,
you can find me at the IDLab offices in Ghent:

Our office is located at the **north-east corner on the 7th floor**.

<h2 id="contact-other">Other</h2>

If you want to contact me for anything else that is not related to my research, such as this website or freelancing offers,
you can e-mail me via <a href="mailto:rubensworks@gmail.com">rubensworks@gmail.com</a>.
