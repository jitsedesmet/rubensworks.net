## Short Biography

<strong>
Ruben Taelman is a finishing PhD student at [IDLab](http://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en), Ghent University – imec, Belgium.
His research concerns the decentralized publication and querying of Linked Data on the Web,
and investigating the trade-offs that exist between server and client.
He has contributed to this domain through publications in journals such as
the [Semantic Web Journal](http://semantic-web-journal.net/)
and the [Journal of Web Semantics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-web-semantics).
Next to that, he is actively applying his research by developing [reusable software](/projects/)
that can be used by developers and other researchers.
Furthermore, he has presented his work at various conferences and workshops such as
the [Web Conference](https://www.iw3c2.org/),
the [International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC)](http://swsa.semanticweb.org/content/international-semantic-web-conference-iswc),
and the [Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC)](https://eswc-conferences.org/).
Additionally, he has served as a reviewer and program committee member for these journals and conferences.
